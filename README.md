# 🔭 OpenSearch Observability Stack

[![E2E Tests](https://github.com/opensearch-project/observability-stack/actions/workflows/e2e.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/opensearch-project/observability-stack/actions/workflows/e2e.yml)

Observability Stack is an open-source stack designed for modern distributed systems. Built on OpenTelemetry, OpenSearch, and Prometheus, Observability Stack provides a complete, pre-configured infrastructure for monitoring microservices, web applications, and AI agents—with first-class support for agent observability through [OpenTelemetry Gen-AI Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/).

![OpenSearch Observability Stack Architecture - docker-compose](./docs/observability-stack-arch-compose.excalidraw.png)

## Components

- **OpenTelemetry Collector**: Receives OTLP data and routes it to appropriate backends
- **Data Prepper**: Transforms and enriches logs and traces before storage
- **OpenSearch**: Stores and indexes logs and traces for search and analysis
- **Prometheus**: Stores time-series metrics data
- **OpenSearch Dashboards**: Provides web-based visualization and exploration
- **PPL (Piped Processing Language)**: Native query language for logs and traces — pipe-based, human-readable, 50+ commands

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Option 1: One-Command Install (Recommended)

Use our interactive installer for the best experience:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opensearch-project/observability-stack/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer will:
- ✅ Check system requirements (Docker/Finch, Git, memory)
- 🎨 Guide you through configuration with a beautiful TUI
- 📦 Pull and start all services automatically
- 🔐 Optionally set custom OpenSearch credentials
- 📊 Display credentials and access points

**Installer flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--simulate` | Preview the installer output without actually installing |
| `--skip-pull` | Skip pulling container images (uses cached images) |
| `--help` | Show help message |

To run the installer locally (e.g. after cloning):
```bash
./install.sh                # Full install
./install.sh --simulate     # Dry run
./install.sh --skip-pull    # Skip image pulls (useful for re-installs)
```

**Installation takes 8-15 minutes.** After completion, access:

| Service | URL | Credentials |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **OpenSearch Dashboards** | http://localhost:5601 | admin / My_password_123!@# |
| **Prometheus** | http://localhost:9090 | (none) |
| **OpenSearch API** | https://localhost:9200 | admin / My_password_123!@# |

### Option 2: Manual Setup

To get started manually with Docker Compose:

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/opensearch-project/observability-stack.git
cd observability-stack
```

### **Optional**: Configure stack
The `.env` file contains all configurable parameters:
- **Example services**: Included by default via `INCLUDE_COMPOSE_EXAMPLES=docker-compose.examples.yml`. Comment out to run only the core stack.
- **OpenTelemetry Demo**: Not enabled by default. Uncomment `INCLUDE_COMPOSE_OTEL_DEMO=docker-compose.otel-demo.yml` to add the full [OpenTelemetry Demo](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/) microservices app for realistic e-commerce telemetry (~2GB additional memory required).

See [Configuration](#configuration) section for more details.

### 2️⃣ Start the stack:  
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts all services including example services (multi-agent travel planner, weather-agent, events-agent, and canary) that generate sample telemetry data.

### 3️⃣ View your Logs and Traces in OpenSearch Dashboards 
**👉 Navigate to http://localhost:5601**    
Username and password can be retrieved from .env file:   
```bash
grep -E '^OPENSEARCH_(USER|PASSWORD)=' .env
```
___ 

### Option 3: AWS Managed Services

Deploy the same observability stack to AWS managed services:

| Local (Docker Compose) | AWS Managed |
|------------------------|-------------|
| OpenSearch | [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/) |
| Prometheus | [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus](https://aws.amazon.com/prometheus/) |
| OTel Collector → Data Prepper | [Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion (OSIS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ingestion.html) |
| OpenSearch Dashboards | [OpenSearch UI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/application.html) |

#### CLI installer — interactive single-command deploy:
```bash
cd aws/cli-installer && npm install
node bin/cli-installer.mjs --managed --pipeline-name obs-stack --region us-west-2
```
See [aws/cli-installer/README.md](aws/cli-installer/README.md) for details.

#### CDK — infrastructure as code:
```bash
cd aws/cdk
npm install
cdk deploy --all
```
See [aws/cdk/README.md](aws/cdk/README.md) for configuration options, architecture details, and sending telemetry via SigV4.

### Destroying the Stack

To stop the stack while preserving your data:
```bash
docker compose down
```

To stop the stack and remove all data volumes:
```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Instrumenting Your Agent

Observability Stack accepts telemetry data via the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) and follows the [OpenTelemetry Gen-AI Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/) for standardized attribute naming and structure for AI agents.

### OTLP Endpoint Configuration

The OTel Collector exposes two OTLP endpoints — choose the one that matches your SDK's protocol:

| Port | Protocol | Endpoint | Used By |
|------|----------|----------|---------|
| **4317** | gRPC | `http://localhost:4317` | OpenTelemetry SDK (default), most language SDKs |
| **4318** | HTTP/protobuf | `http://localhost:4318` | Strands SDK (`setup_otlp_exporter()`), HTTP-based exporters |

Configure via environment variables:
```bash
# For gRPC-based exporters (OpenTelemetry SDK default)
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4317"

# For HTTP/protobuf exporters (Strands SDK, OTLP HTTP exporters)
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:4318"
```

> **Note:** The Strands Agents SDK's `StrandsTelemetry().setup_otlp_exporter()` uses HTTP/protobuf, which requires **port 4318**. Using port 4317 with Strands will silently fail. When using `OTLPSpanExporter` directly with gRPC (as in the examples below), use **port 4317**.

### Example: Manual Instrumentation with OpenTelemetry
For complete example, see [examples/plain-agents/weather-agent](./examples/plain-agents/weather-agent)
```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

# Configure OTLP exporter (gRPC — port 4317)
tracer_provider = TracerProvider()
otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://localhost:4317", insecure=True)
tracer_provider.add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter))
trace.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)

# Create tracer
tracer = trace.get_tracer("my-agent")

# Instrument agent invocation
with tracer.start_as_current_span("invoke_agent") as span:
    span.set_attribute("gen_ai.operation.name", "invoke_agent")
    span.set_attribute("gen_ai.agent.name", "Weather Assistant")
    span.set_attribute("gen_ai.request.model", "gpt-4")
    
    # Your agent logic here
    result = agent.run("What's the weather in Paris?")
    
    span.set_attribute("gen_ai.usage.input_tokens", 150)
    span.set_attribute("gen_ai.usage.output_tokens", 75)
```
### Example: Instrument with StrandsTelemetry
For complete example, see [examples/strands/code-assistant](./examples/strands/code-assistant)
```python
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
from strands import Agent
from strands.models import BedrockModel
from strands.telemetry import StrandsTelemetry

# 1. Initialize StrandsTelemetry (auto-instruments with GenAI semantic conventions)
telemetry = StrandsTelemetry()

# 2. Configure OTLP exporter to send traces to your observability stack
#    Note: This example uses gRPC (port 4317) with OTLPSpanExporter directly.
#    If using setup_otlp_exporter() instead, it uses HTTP/protobuf (port 4318).
exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="localhost:4317", insecure=True)
telemetry.tracer_provider.add_span_processor(BatchSpanProcessor(exporter))

# 3. Use your agent normally - telemetry happens automatically!
agent = Agent(
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant",
    model=BedrockModel(model_id="us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0"),
    tools=[your_tools]
)

# Every agent call is automatically traced with GenAI semantic conventions
agent("What's the weather like?")
```


## Managing Services

### Common Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# View logs for specific service
docker compose logs -f opensearch

# Stop services (keeps data)
docker compose down

# Stop and remove all data

```

## Ports

| Port | Service | Protocol | Description |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **4317** | OTel Collector | gRPC | OTLP gRPC receiver — used by most OpenTelemetry SDKs |
| **4318** | OTel Collector | HTTP | OTLP HTTP receiver — used by Strands SDK, browser-based exporters |

| **9090** | Prometheus | HTTP | Prometheus Web UI and API |
| **9200** | OpenSearch | HTTPS | REST API (self-signed cert, use `curl -k`) |
| **21890** | Data Prepper | gRPC | Internal OTLP receiver (from OTel Collector) |

When example services are enabled:

| Port | Service | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **8000** | weather-agent | Weather lookup API with fault injection |
| **8002** | events-agent | Local events lookup API |
| **8003** | travel-planner | Multi-agent orchestrator |

When OpenTelemetry Demo is enabled:

| Port | Service | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **8080** | frontend-proxy | Demo telescope web store |
| **8080/loadgen/** | load-generator | Load generator dashboard |
| **8080/feature** | feature-flag | Feature flag management UI |

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The [.env](./.env) file contains all configurable parameters. Edit this file before starting the stack to customize your deployment.

### Including Example Services

By default, the stack includes example services (multi-agent travel planner, weather-agent, events-agent, and canary) via the `INCLUDE_COMPOSE_EXAMPLES` variable in `.env`:

```env
INCLUDE_COMPOSE_EXAMPLES=docker-compose.examples.yml
```

**Example services:**
- **travel-planner** (port 8003): Multi-agent orchestrator demonstrating distributed tracing
- **weather-agent** (port 8000): Weather lookup with fault injection
- **events-agent** (port 8002): Local events lookup
- **canary**: Generates test traffic with fault injection

**To run without examples:**
- Comment out the `INCLUDE_COMPOSE_EXAMPLES` line in `.env`
- Restart the stack: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d`

### Running with OpenTelemetry Demo

Observability Stack can run alongside the [OpenTelemetry Demo](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/demo/) application, a full microservices e-commerce app that generates realistic telemetry data.

**To enable OpenTelemetry Demo**, uncomment in `.env`:
```env
INCLUDE_COMPOSE_OTEL_DEMO=docker-compose.otel-demo.yml
```

Then restart the stack:
```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```

**Access points when running with OTel Demo:**
- Web Store: http://localhost:8080/
- Load Generator UI: http://localhost:8080/loadgen/
- Feature Flags UI: http://localhost:8080/feature

**Note:** Running with OTel Demo significantly increases resource requirements. See [Resource Requirements](#resource-requirements) below.

### OpenSearch Credentials

The default credentials are `admin` / `My_password_123!@#` (development only).

**Setting credentials during install:**

The interactive installer prompts "Customize OpenSearch credentials?" — enter `Y` to set a custom username and password. The installer writes them to `.env`, and all services pick them up automatically.

**Changing credentials after install:**

1. **Edit `.env` file** (single source of truth):
   ```env
   OPENSEARCH_USER=your-new-username
   OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD=your-new-password
   ```

2. **Restart the stack** (remove volumes to clear stale credentials):
   ```bash
   docker compose down -v
   docker compose up -d
   ```

**How it works:** `.env` is the single source of truth for credentials. OpenSearch, Dashboards, and the init script read from `.env` via environment variables. Data Prepper uses a [template](docker-compose/data-prepper/pipelines.template.yaml) with `OPENSEARCH_USER`/`OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD` placeholders that are injected via `sed` at container startup — no manual config edits needed. OpenSearch uses HTTPS with self-signed certificates, so use `-k` flag with curl commands.

## Resource Requirements

| Configuration | Memory Usage | Recommended Minimum |
|---------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Core stack only | ~1.1 GB | 4 GB RAM |
| Core + OTel Demo | ~3.0 GB | 8 GB RAM |

**Core services** (~1.1 GB total):
- OpenSearch: ~1.6 GB
- Data Prepper: ~650 MB
- OpenSearch Dashboards: ~230 MB
- OTel Collector: ~100 MB
- Prometheus: ~40 MB
- Example services (weather-agent, canary): ~100 MB

**OpenTelemetry Demo adds** (~1.9 GB total):
- Kafka: ~500 MB
- Java services (fraud-detection, ad, accounting): ~540 MB
- Frontend, load-generator, and other services: ~850 MB

**Check resource usage:**
```bash
docker stats --no-stream

# For Finch users
finch stats --no-stream
```

## Production Readiness

⚠️ **Observability Stack is NOT production-ready out of the box.** The default configuration prioritizes ease of use for development and testing. Before deploying to production, you must address the following:

### Security Hardening Required

- **Authentication**: Enable OpenSearch security plugin and configure user authentication
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Encryption**: Enable TLS/SSL for all HTTP endpoints and encrypt data at rest
- **Network Security**: Implement network policies, firewalls, and limit exposed ports
- **Secrets Management**: Use secure secret storage instead of default passwords

### Operational Requirements

- **High Availability**: Configure multi-node OpenSearch cluster and redundant services
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement automated backup procedures and test recovery
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerting for the observability stack itself
- **Resource Limits**: Configure appropriate CPU, memory, and disk quotas
- **Data Lifecycle**: Implement production-appropriate retention and archival policies

### Security Considerations

The default configuration includes these development-friendly settings that are **NOT secure**:

- OpenSearch security is enabled but uses default credentials (admin/My_password_123!@#)
- Self-signed TLS certificates with verification disabled
- Permissive CORS settings
- All services exposed without network isolation

**Never deploy the default configuration to production or expose it to untrusted networks.**

## Troubleshooting

### Services Won't Start

Check Docker resource allocation:
```bash
docker stats
```

View service logs:
```bash
docker compose logs <service-name>
```

### Data Not Appearing

Verify OpenTelemetry Collector is receiving data:
```bash
docker compose logs otel-collector
```

Check Data Prepper pipeline status:
```bash
docker compose logs data-prepper
```

Verify OpenSearch indices:
```bash
curl -k -u admin:My_password_123!@# https://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v
```

### Performance Issues

Check resource usage:
```bash
docker stats
```

Adjust resource limits in docker-compose.yml or values.yaml for Helm.

### Network Removal Error on Shutdown

If `docker compose down` fails with an error like:
```
failed to remove network observability-stack-network: Error response from daemon: error while removing network: network observability-stack-network id ab129adaabcd7ab35cddb1fbe8dc2a68b3c730b9fb9384c5c1e7f5ca015c27d9 has active endpoints
```

This typically occurs when containers from other compose files are still running. Try:
```bash
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

Or stop all containers using the network first:
```bash
docker network inspect observability-stack-network --format '{{range .Containers}}{{.Name}} {{end}}' | xargs -r docker stop
docker compose down
```

For more troubleshooting guidance, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Project Status: 🚧 Alpha

**Note**: As the OpenSearch agent observability ecosystem grows, this repository *may* eventually be consolidated into a unified "container-recipes" repository alongside other quickstart setups. This would provide a centralized location for all OpenSearch deployment patterns. However we'll communicate any such changes through the repository's issue tracker and release notes.

### Temporary Workarounds

The current configuration includes a custom OpenSearch Dockerfile (`docker-compose/opensearch/Dockerfile`) that removes some plugins facing issues during OpenSearch 3.5.0 development. This workaround will be removed once OpenSearch 3.5.0 is officially released and stabilized. At that point, we'll switch back to using the standard OpenSearch Docker image directly.

Track progress: [OpenSearch 3.5.0 Release](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/releases)

## Query Language: PPL

The Observability Stack uses **Piped Processing Language (PPL)** as its native query language for logs and traces. PPL is a pipe-based language designed for the way operators actually investigate data:

```
source = logs-otel-v1*
| where severityNumber >= 17
| stats count() as errors by `resource.attributes.service.name`
| sort - errors
```

PPL provides 50+ commands and 200+ functions covering search, aggregation, pattern discovery, machine learning, joins, and more. See the [PPL documentation](https://observability.opensearch.org/docs/ppl/) for the full reference with live playground examples.
