title: Forecasting
description: Predict future values of time-series observability data
---

OpenSearch Forecasting extends the anomaly detection framework to predict future values of your time-series data. Use it to anticipate capacity needs, predict traffic patterns, and proactively address issues before they occur.

## Key concepts

- **Forecaster**: A configuration similar to an anomaly detector that defines what data to forecast, which features to predict, and the forecast horizon.
- **Forecast horizon**: How far into the future to predict. The forecaster generates predicted values for each interval up to the horizon.
- **Features**: The aggregations to forecast - the same feature types used in anomaly detection (averages, counts, sums, etc.).
- **Confidence intervals**: Each predicted value includes upper and lower bounds indicating the range of expected values.

## How it fits the Observability Stack

Forecasting is useful for capacity planning and proactive operations:

| Use case | What to forecast |
|---|---|
| Capacity planning | Disk usage, memory consumption, index size |
| Traffic prediction | Request rate, connection count |
| Cost estimation | Ingestion volume, storage growth |
| SLA management | Latency trends, error rate trajectory |

## Getting started

1. Open OpenSearch Dashboards and navigate to **Forecasting** (available alongside Anomaly Detection).
2. Create a **forecaster** by selecting an index and defining features to predict.
3. Set the **forecast horizon** - how many intervals ahead to predict.
4. Run the forecaster to generate predictions.
5. View predicted values alongside actual data to validate accuracy.

## Pairing with alerting

Combine forecasting with [Alerting](/docs/alerting/) to get notified when forecasts predict a threshold breach. For example, alert when forecasted disk usage is predicted to exceed 80% within the next 24 hours.
