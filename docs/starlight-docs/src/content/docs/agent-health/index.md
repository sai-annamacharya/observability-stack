Agent Health is an evaluation and observability framework for AI agents. It helps you measure agent performance through "Golden Path" trajectory comparison — where an LLM judge evaluates agent actions against expected outcomes. Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/opensearch-project/agent-health) for source code and contributions.

## Quick start

```bash
# Start Agent Health with demo data (no configuration needed)
npx @opensearch-project/agent-health@latest
```

Opens http://localhost:4001 with pre-loaded sample data for exploration.

## Who uses Agent Health

- **AI teams** building autonomous agents (RCA, customer support, data analysis)
- **QA engineers** testing agent behavior across scenarios
- **Platform teams** monitoring agent performance in production

## Key capabilities

- Real-time agent execution streaming and visualization
- LLM-based evaluation with pass/fail scoring
- Batch experiments comparing agents and models
- OpenTelemetry trace integration for performance analysis
- Pluggable connectors for different agent types (REST, SSE, CLI)

## Architecture

![Agent Health Architecture](/docs/images/agent-health/architecture.png)

Agent Health uses a client-server architecture where all clients (UI, CLI) access storage through a unified HTTP API. The server handles agent communication via pluggable connectors and proxies LLM judge calls to AWS Bedrock.

## Supported connectors

| Connector | Protocol | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `agui-streaming` | AG-UI SSE | ML-Commons agents (default) |
| `rest` | HTTP POST | Non-streaming REST APIs |
| `subprocess` | CLI | Command-line tools |
| `claude-code` | Claude CLI | Claude Code agent comparison |
| `mock` | In-memory | Demo and testing |

For creating custom connectors, see [Connectors](/docs/agent-health/configuration/connectors/).
